**Subject:** Action Required: Model Persistence and Reliability - Phase 5

**Objective:**
This directive formally initiates **Phase 5: Model Persistence and Reliability**. The primary objective is to eliminate the system's operational volatility by implementing a robust mechanism to persist trained ML models to disk and automatically load them when the application starts. This will ensure that a server restart does not erase the trained models.

**Context:**
The successful completion of Phase 4 has restored data history functionality. Now, we must address the architectural issue where trained models exist only in memory. The `OPERATIONAL_READINESS_REPORT` confirms that `joblib` is an available dependency and that system paths are managed via hard-coded conventions, which should inform your implementation.

**Required Tasks:**

1.  **Implement Model Persistence:**
    * Create a new directory at the project root named `models/`.
    * In the `ModelTrainingService`, after a model is successfully trained, use `joblib.dump` to save the final, trained pipeline object to a uniquely named file within the new `models/` directory.
    * Modify the `prediction_sets` table in the SQLite database to include a new column, `model_artifact_path`, and store the path to the saved model file in this column for the relevant prediction set.

2.  **Implement Model Loading on Startup:**
    * Add logic to the application's main startup sequence (e.g., in `app.py` or a suitable initialization module).
    * This startup logic must query the database to find the `model_artifact_path` for the most recent `is_current = TRUE` prediction set for each model type.
    * It will then use `joblib.load` to load the model file from that path into the appropriate service instance, making it immediately available for predictions without requiring manual retraining.

**Deliverable:**
Upon completion of all tasks, you are required to produce a formal **"Model Persistence Implementation Report"**. This report must detail the new model saving and loading architecture, document any database schema changes, and include validation that the application successfully loads and uses persisted models after a server restart.

**The first page of your report must be formatted exactly as follows:**
