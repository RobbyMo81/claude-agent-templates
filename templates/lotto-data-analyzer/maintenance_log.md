## Recommendations

1. **Review the unified markdown folder** to ensure all documentation is properly organized
2. **Update any references** to the moved markdown files in your code
3. **Run all tests** to ensure system functionality is not affected by archived files
4. **Consider keeping the archive** for at least one release cycle

To restore an archived file, copy it from the archive directory back to its original location.
