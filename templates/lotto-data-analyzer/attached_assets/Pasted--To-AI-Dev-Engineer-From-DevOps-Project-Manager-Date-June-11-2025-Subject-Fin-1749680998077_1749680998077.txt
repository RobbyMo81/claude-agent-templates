**Subject:** Final Documentation Request: Operational Readiness and Environment Report

**Objective:**
Before we commence the next cycle of development (Phases 4-6), it is imperative that we complete our system documentation with a final report focused on the project's operational aspects. The objective is to document the "connective tissue" of the application: how it was migrated, how it is configured, and how its environment is defined.

**Context:**
The previous reports have given us excellent insight into the application's internal architecture and data flows. To ensure we have a complete and holistic understanding before implementing further enhancements, we must now document the operational and environmental components. This will provide a full picture of the system, de-risk future development, and serve as a critical reference for long-term maintenance.

**Required Report Sections:**
Please provide a detailed report, including code snippets and explanations where applicable, covering the following three areas:

1.  **Legacy Data Migration Script Analysis:**
    * Provide the complete Python script that was used to perform the Phase 3 data migration from the legacy `.joblib` files to the SQLite database.
    * Add detailed, code-level comments to the script explaining the logic for reading the legacy data, transforming it, and mapping it to the new SQLite schema. Pay special attention to how the `is_active` and `is_current` flags were handled for this historical data.

2.  **Configuration Management and File Paths:**
    * Document the application's strategy for configuration management.
    * Identify where all critical file paths (e.g., for the SQLite database, CSV datasets, and backup directories) are defined. Are they hard-coded in the Python modules, or are they managed via a central configuration file (e.g., `config.py`, `.env`, `config.yaml`)? Provide the relevant code snippets.

3.  **Application Dependencies:**
    * Provide the definitive list of all external Python libraries and their exact versions required to run the application.
    * This should be presented in the standard `requirements.txt` format (e.g., `pandas==2.2.0`, `streamlit==1.35.0`). If this file already exists in the project, please include its full contents in the report.

**Deliverable:**
Upon completion of your analysis, you are required to produce a formal **"Operational Readiness Report"**.

**The first page of your report must be formatted exactly as follows:**

```
Title: Operational Readiness Report: Migration, Configuration, and Dependencies
Report Date: [Date of Completion]
Analysis Scope: Code-level review of the legacy data migration script, system configuration management, and application dependencies.
System Status: Documented - Operational components verified.
Analyst: [Your Name/Identifier]
